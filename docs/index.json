The second atomic species yields phononic excitations, which are used to entangle collective spins.

Lattice gauge theories are a particular important class of quantum systems with an extensive number of local constraints and play a central role in high energy physics, condensed matter and quantum information. Whereas recent experimental progress points towards the feasibility of large-scale quantum simulation of Abelian gauge theories, the quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories appears still elusive. In this paper we present minimal non-Abelian lattice gauge theories, whereby we introduce the necessary formalism in well-known Abelian gauge theories, such as the Jaynes-Cumming model. In particular, we show that certain minimal non-Abelian lattice gauge theories can be mapped to three or four level systems, for which the design of a quantum simulator is standard with current technologies. Further we give an upper bound for the Hilbert space dimension of a one dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory, and argue that the implementation with current digital quantum computer appears feasible.","tags":["Quantum Simulation","Lattice Gauge Theory"],"title":"From the Jaynes–Cummings model to non-abelian gauge theories: a guided tour for the quantum engineer.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fred Jendrzejewski","Apoorva Hegde","Rohit Prasad Bhatt"],"categories":null,"content":"This is a block seminar, which will be organized together with experts from IBM-Q, we will explore the possibilities of quantum hardware like cold atom machines and IBM-Q to solve a variety of problems.

Hereby, we put the largest possible focus on a hands-on experience, where we try to support the students to solve specific problems.\nThe seminar is planned to be loosely based on the ideas of hackathons. As such, we have roughly planned the following schedule:\nEach day has a morning session starting at 9am and an afternoon session. On Monday you will obtain an introduction into the two main platforms we would like to employ in this lecture. On Tuesday morning we discuss the proposed tools for coding, which will be most likely jupyter environments, github and python.

This rise was fueled by activities of massive commercial players like IBM, Google, Microsoft and large investments in startups like D-Wave, Rigetti, Xanadu, Zapata and Cambridge Quantum Computing. The work of these companies typically focuses on universal quantum computers, which hold the premise of exponential speed-up for a variety of NP-hard problems. However, this universality usually comes at the price of algorithmic overhead for a wide range of tasks which generally leads to worse overall fidelity. If we give up the constraint of a universal quantum computer, we can build specialized quantum hardware for the problems of interest. Such systems are called quantum simulators. Ultra-cold atoms have become a leading platform of such quantum simulators at a large scale. Most importantly for us, they are the experimental platform our research group is working on. Already demonstrated applications involve an enormous variety of condensed-matter problems like e.g. the Hubbard model (Citation: Bloch \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32; 2008) Bloch,\u0026#32; I.,\u0026#32; Dalibard,\u0026#32; J.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Zwerger,\u0026#32; W. \u0026#32; (2008). \u0026#32;Many-body physics with ultracold gases.

However, quantum simulators are currently limited to an academic environment because of   the complexity of constructing the experimental hardware, which involves substantial technical know-how and funding.\n  the specificity of knowledge and language required to understand/communicate the experiment.\n  the need to formulate the target problem as a Hamiltonian.\n  the manual compilation of programs on this hardware class.   A circuit-based approach to ultra-cold atom quantum simulators would alleviate points 2) and 3) as we could agree on the quantum circuit, given the hardware-specific operations, and run it on the experiment. Integrating the system with a software stack like PennyLane would additionally allow to address and run the experiment on a higher level and substantially lower the barrier of entry for users outside of the cold-atom and quantum physics community. These points motivated our research group to have a look how our experimental hardware, which is controlled by the Labscript Suite, can be integrated into PennyLane to run quantum circuits on ultra-cold atom devices. Our group is part of SynQS, working on two ultra-cold atom experiments, the NaLi and SoPa (named after the two atomic species used in the lab).\nWhy use ultra-cold atoms as a quantum information platform ? For ultra-cold atoms, the processing unit is not a qubit and as such, the natural operations are not generally the commonly used and widely known qubit operations such as $X,Y,Z$ rotations, Hadamard $H$ gates, entangling $CNOT$ or $XX$ gates with oberservables like $\\sigma^z$ expectations. Instead, our NaLi experiment implements a $X(\\theta)$ rotation on a long spin of many bosons on one optical lattice site. Additionally, the system naturally evolves under a many-body Hamiltonian $H_{mb}$, coupling the the atomic species.\nWhat is the qubit equivalent of those operations? The relation is pretty complex - and that is the nice thing! Cold atoms are different. Given their success in the quantum simulation of many-body problems, they could make for an exciting quantum information processor that is complementary to universal devices. So as a general rule of thumb, it could be argued that cold atom machines often give up some control over individual particles, leading to much bigger systems. Additionally, because we work with a large number of atoms, we can measure obtain rather precise estimates of expectation values with a single state preparation and one measurement. A concrete example from our group Before we go into more detailed discussion of our implementation, we will present a concrete example of our device, where we study lattice gauge theories. These theories have become a popular benchmark for quantum simulators (Citation: Kokail \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32; 2019) Kokail,\u0026#32; C.,\u0026#32; Maier,\u0026#32; C.,\u0026#32; Bijnen,\u0026#32; R.,\u0026#32; Brydges,\u0026#32; T.,\u0026#32; Joshi,\u0026#32; M.,\u0026#32; Jurcevic,\u0026#32; P.,\u0026#32; Muschik,\u0026#32; C.,\u0026#32; Silvi,\u0026#32; P.,\u0026#32; Blatt,\u0026#32; R.,\u0026#32; Roos,\u0026#32; C.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Zoller,\u0026#32; P. \u0026#32; (2019). \u0026#32;Self-verifying variational quantum simulation of lattice models.

On our NaLi machine, we recently performed experiments on the building block for certain quantum simulators that would be suited for theories from high-energy physics (Citation: Mil \u0026amp; al.)

Science,\u0026#32;367.\u0026#32;1128–1130. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaz5312 . These experiments are performed with two atomic species, sodium and lithium, that can be prepared in two internal spin states. Re-thinking our analog quantum simulation for the purpose of quantum circuits, we can represent the sodium atoms as a very long spin state $\\left|\\psi_N\\right\\rangle$. The observable outcomes are $L_z=-\\frac{N}{2},\\cdots,\\frac{N}{2}$, where $N\\sim10^5$ is the number of sodium atoms. On a quantum computer this should be compared to a qubit, for which we can only measure two outcomes $L_z=\\pm\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe lithium atoms on the other hand can be described by the states on two independent sites $\\left|\\psi_p\\right\\rangle$ and $|\\psi_v\\rangle$. For each site we can observe that number of atoms that sit on it. The observable outcomes are then $n_{p/v} = 0, \\dots, n$ where $n\\sim 10^4$ is the number of lithium atoms. In this formulation and analogous to other circuit-based quantum computing devices, the NaLi experiment then consists of three main stages:\n  The atoms are prepared in some initial state\u0026hellip;\n  controlled through a set of operations/gates\u0026hellip;\n  and then measured to evaluate the operators $L_z$ and $N_{p,v}$\n  Without having to dig through all the physical details to understand the publication (Citation: Mil \u0026amp; al.)

The results gain a clear intuitive meaning through the quantum circuits even though the system that is being simulated is not known.

We have our own experiment in the lab which implements a non-standard device for quantum simulation and thus some of our requirements are (roughly in order of importance):\n  Can we integrate our own experimental hardware into the framework and potentially run it from there?\n  How strong of an assumption is made about the computational unit of the hardware? Does it have to be strictly qubits/photons etc.?\n  Is the framework open-source and shows openness to the academic community?\n  Can also integrate classical simulators that are based on our hardware?\n  Does it provide some sort of user management and safety measures to avoid unqualified users from killing the system?\n  Lets give a brief overview of how we answered those questions with regard to PennyLane. PennyLane is designed for users to write and use their own plugin, which is what they call the integration of quantum computing devices into the framework. Officially, it only supports qubit and continuous variable devices and not more general approaches but we may be able to integrate bosonic and fermionic atoms flexibly as the code itself is not very restricted. Other big platorms like Qiskit, Forest and Strawberry Fields focus exclusively on their own quantum computing hardware or simulator without the possibility to integrate your own. PennyLane is open-source and Python-based, which is perfect as the Labscript Suite controlling our experiment is so, too. Additionally, the company behind PennyLane, Xanadu, is a partly academic player who is very open in their publications and supports a great community around the software. The framework allows to add simulators to the framework device which mirror the functionality of the hardware. It performs various parameter range checks for the system and the operations used. Not built-in is user a system for management which allows only registered users to run the experiment from a queue. We would have to implement this ourselves.\nAll-in-all, PennyLane seems to be the best and likely only fit for our endeavors. Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about it in more detail.\nPennylane  A cross-platform Python library for quantum machine learning, automatic differentiation, and optimization of hybrid quantum-classical computations.\n  PennyLane as the connecting puzzle piece.   PennyLane is created by Xanadu  and presents itself as the connecting puzzle piece between powerful established python libraries for machine learning, and quantum computing platforms. It provides readily implemented quantum algorithms for quantum machine learning, quantum chemistry and optimization. A particular algorithm provided in PennyLane is automatic differentiation of quantum circuits which allows to perform shot-efficient application of classical-quantum algorithms such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Existing popular quantum computing platforms such as Qiskit for qubits and Strawberry Fields (also created by Xanadu) for photons have written plugins for PennyLane which make their quantum simulators or quantum hardware accessible through it and with that PennyLane\u0026rsquo;s quantum algorithms and automatic differentiation feature. In fact, any quantum lab can adapt the plugin template for their own experiment and simulators to assimilate their own specific workflow with PennyLane where users are generally able to use the same workflow accross platforms and know what to expect. Fig. 3 below shows a typical way of using PennyLane in a classical-quantum hybrid algorithm. Here, the default qubit simulator by PennyLane is used. After writing our own plugin, we can call that device, change the quantum circuit to contain the supported operations and the workflow is otherwise the same. All-in-all, the interface is very robust towards changing up the quantum backend (especially when they support the same operations).\n Typical simple way of using PennyLane by instantiating the device, defining the parametrized quantum circuit and the cost, and calculating the gradient for the classical parameters.   Our workflow and connecting PennyLane to our hardware The current state of our pennylane_ls plugin for ultra-cold atom experiments can be viewed in this public github repository. It provides examples from our labs and can guide you to adapting it to your own experiment and needs.\nOur group uses the Labscript suite to coordinate and execute experimental sequences with cold atoms.   The labscript suite is a collection of programs, which work together to form a control system for autonomous, hardware timed experiments.  On the deepest level it is very nuts and bolts with plenty of commands in the style of Fig. 4 below.\n The Experiment.py (left) defines the experimental sequence of a Labscript-controlled lab experiment, here by calling functions from NaLiFunctions.py at given times. The function UMPUMP (right) shows the exact low level hardware instructions that are to be executed.   The Experiment.py file determines the exact sequence of hardware controls that is executed during the measurement. It contains Labscript syntax and is fed into the Labscript Python compiler Runmanager. Our approach for combining Labscript with PennyLane is sumarized in Fig. 5.\nWith the help of the plugin functions pre_apply(), apply() and post_apply(), we generate a new Experiment.py on the fly depending on the quantum circuit programmed through the PennyLane interface.\n The functions pre_apply(), apply() and post_apply() are used to generate a new Experiment.py on the fly for each quantum circuit in PennyLane. apply() loops through the operations in the circuit while the other functions always write the same necessary code for the compilation.   In other words, our PennyLane plugin translates a quantum circuit to an Experiment.py which our control system can interpret.\nThe expval() method from the plugin is then used to send the newly generated file to the Runmanager and engage the sequence. The output shots are then evaluated and the method returns an expectation.\nA detailled discussion of the technical details can be found in the README.md of the public repository. The features of our plugin currently include:\n  Proposing a higher-level control of experiments that are run controlled by the Labscript Suite through PennyLane.\n  A framework device that provides a template for labs with Labscript to quickly adapt code for their own setup.\n  Including two devices of the SynQS group at the Kirchhoff-Institute for Physics of Prof. Fred Jendrzejewski.\n  The framework device in SynQSDevice.py is written such that a group which uses the Labscript Suite to run their experiment can adapt the module easily to their own setup.\nFinishing up this project, we have succeed in providing first circuit control to our experiments through PennyLane and extract the results. However, much further automation will be needed to fully leverage the possibilities of the quantum circuits that we can run on our ultra-cold atom devices.\nFuture steps To get the project towards a full Pennylane plugin, we have to:\n  Give wires a meaning.\n  Operations need to be restricted to certain wires, especially when different atomic species are involved.\n  Implement true remote control of the lab through the pennylane_ls module.\n  Implement full result post-processing that is currently used in the lab.\n  Implement some kind of user management.\n  While it seems quite clear how we can implement points 1 - 4, it seems to be a whole new problem to implement some kind of user management for our systems. In any case the first steps are remarkably promising and we will see how the quantum circuits can be efficiently employed in ultra-cold atom experiments.\n","date":1590364800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609843797,"objectID":"bc6b7d038c1284e30e6cbb6f57910004","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/post/2020-atomic-quantum-circuits/","publishdate":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-atomic-quantum-circuits/","section":"post","summary":"In this blog-post, we present our path and thoughts towards using ultra-cold atom experiments for quantum computation.

Experimentally, the building block is realized by Bose-Einstein condensates of lithium and sodium condense d in a single optical dipole trap. Gauge and matter degrees of freedom are mapped in this system onto the internal states of the atomic species. The necessary U(1) gauge invariance is realized via heteronuclear spin changing collisions (SCC) between both species.\nThe building block represents an important stepstone towards quantum simulation of extended lattice gauge theories as, within the same setting, it features systematic protection of gauge invariance, a realistic approach of the continuum limit for gauge fields and the potential for scalability.\nUsing SCC, systematic protection of gauge invariance in the system is achieved by exploiting the inherent angular momentum conservation in the atomic mixture. The continuum limit of gauge fields is recovered in the framework of quantum link models by working with Bose-Einstein condensates with high atom numbers in the order of $10^5$. The building block can be scaled up to an extended U(1) lattice gauge theory by arranging individual building blocks on the sites of an optical lattice and connecting them via Raman-assisted tunneling.\nGreat tunability of our experimental building block is demonstrated by studying SCC dynamics as a function of various experimental parameters. We observe coherent SCC interactions between both species after an initialization quench. Furthermore, we recorded the SCC resonance as a function of this initialization quench and the offset magnetic field. We present a theoretical framework for the building block model based on a mean field theory with a phenomenological decoherence term. Within this framework the experimental SCC measurements are excellently described, identifying our experimental system as a faithful representation of the building block.\nOur results open up the possibility for extended lattice gauge theories based on multiple building blocks. These systems will allow for quantum simulation of gauge theories with the potential to address important questions in modern physics that can currently not be simulated by classical computational techniques.","tags":["Ultracold","Atomic mixture","Lithium","Sodium","lattice gauge theory","dynamical gauge fields"],"title":"Experimental realization of U(1) gauge invariance in ultracold atomic mixtures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Hesse","Kerim Köster","Jakob Steiner","Julia Michl","Vadim Vorobyov","Durga Dasari","Jörg Wrachtrup","Fred Jendrzejewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1584489600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609656932,"objectID":"8c5f7fc3f01a1aaa03efe97e18d768b5","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/publication/hesse-2020/","publishdate":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hesse-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"In atomic physics experiments, magnetic fields allow to control the interactions between atoms, eg. near Feshbach resonances, or by employing spin changing collisions. The magnetic field control is typically performed indirectly, by stabilizing the current of Helmholtz coils producing the large bias field. Here, we overcome the limitations of such an indirect control through a direct feedback scheme, which is based on nitrogen-vacancy centers acting as a sensor. This allows us to measure and stabilize magnetic fields of 46.6 G down to 1.2 mG RMS noise, with the potential of reaching much higher field strengths. Because the magnetic field is measured directly, we reach minimum shot-to-shot fluctuations of 0.32(4) ppm on a 22 minute time interval, ensuring high reproducibility of experiments. This approach extends the direct magnetic field control to high magnetic fields, which could enable new precise quantum simulations in this regime.","tags":["NV","magnetometry","under-grad","atomic-mixtures","experiment","ultracold","kip"],"title":"Direct control of high magnetic fields for cold atom experiments based on NV centers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Rudolph"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1584057600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609656932,"objectID":"529632f6b7f7eeac31a481d77bca5207","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/publication/thesis/rudolph-2020/","publishdate":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thesis/rudolph-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The aim of this work is to explore practical implementations of Quantum and Quantum-assisted Machine Learning algorithms and benchmark potential benefits of utilizing quantum phenomena in Quantum-assisted Neural Networks with qubit layers.

The QaG provides promising indications that quantum phenomena may enhance performance of a generative neural network. This work also considers Hamiltonian-based and gate-based implementations of quantum-assisted Autoencoders.

Using this trap, an implementation of a quantized Otto cycle with the sodium-lithium mixture experiment that cools down a cloud of sodium atoms to quantum degeneracy while conserving the number of atoms may be possible. Three key characteristics which are crucial to the quantum Otto cycle are described: First, spatial movement of the lithium cloud is implemented by adjusting the relative phase of the two interfering beams up to $\\Delta \\theta = 3\\pi$. Second, the energy level spacing in the trap are adjustable by controlling the laser intensity. Third, the spatial overlap between clouds of sodium and lithium atoms can be optimized by an accordion setup with two electric tunable lenses which allows to change the periodicity of the standing-wave dynamically by a factor of two. Furthermore, the stability of the setup is characterized. An estimate on the trap storage time based on heating rates by spontaneous emission, intensity and trap center fluctuations is given. In the current setup, the storage time is limited by detuning and power of the laser. With a 5nm blue-detuned setup the estimated storage time is up to 4s, whereas intensity and trap center fluctuations would allow for a estimated lifetime of bigger than 80s. The longterm trap center stability was characterized and substantially improved by temperature stabilization of the electro-optical modulator crystal to approximately $0.3/\\pi = 12 h$. In the near future, this setup will be installed on the main experiment, allowing the sodium-lithium experiment to become a test-bed for quantum thermodynamics.","tags":["Ultracold","Atomic mixture","Lithium","Sodium","quantumthermo","Quantum thermodynamics","Accordion lattice"],"title":"Implementing an Optical Accordion Lattice for the Realization of a Quantized Otto Cycle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P Bienias","S Subhankar","Y Wang","T-c Tsui","Fred Jendrzejewski","T Tiecke","L Jiang","S L Rolston","J V Porto","A V Gorshkov"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1530921600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609310819,"objectID":"46d6c331523d8343e22780a13599718f","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/publication/bienias-2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bienias-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"There has been a recent surge of interest and progress in creating subwavelength free-space optical potentials for ultracold atoms.

Future progress towards scalable quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories, however, hinges crucially on the efficient use of experimental resources. As we argue in this work, due to the fundamental non-uniqueness of discretizing the relativistic Dirac Hamiltonian, the lattice representation of gauge theories allows for an optimization that up to now has been left unexplored. We exemplify our discussion with lattice quantum electrodynamics in two-dimensional space-time, where we show that the formulation through Wilson fermions provides several advantages over the previously considered staggered fermions. Notably, it enables a strongly simplified optical lattice setup and it reduces the number of degrees of freedom required to simulate dynamical gauge fields. Exploiting the optimal representation, we propose an experiment based on a mixture of ultracold atoms trapped in a tilted optical lattice.

And we will walk through this control in the simple case of intensity control, which is a very straight-forward example, which allows us to understand the basics.\nTerminology and Basics This section closely follow ideas from (Citation: Bechhoefer,\u0026#32; 2005) Bechhoefer,\u0026#32; J. \u0026#32; (2005). \u0026#32;Feedback for physicists: A tutorial essay on control. Reviews of Modern Physics,\u0026#32;77(3).\u0026#32;783–836. https://doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.77.783  . A generic feedback control is seen in Fig. 1. A system $G(s)$ is being controlled with a control signal $r(s)$. The goal of the feedback is for the output of the system $y(s)$ to follow the control signal $r(s)$. The general idea is the following: measure the output of the system, determine its difference to the control voltage to get error $\\epsilon$ and use this error signal as input for some control law $K(s)$ that tries to minimize the error signal.\n Block diagram showing a generic feedback control. The system G(s) is controlled by the control law K(s).   Here we analyze the system in frequency space, where $s=i\\omega$. This is a convenient way to analyze control systems. An easy way to measure quantity of such a system is the closed-loop transfer function $T$:\n$$T= \\frac{y(s)}{r(s)} = \\frac{K(s)G(s)}{1+K(s)G(s)}$$\nFor system stability the loop-shape $H$ is important and can be determined from $T$: $$ H = K(s)G(s) = \\frac{T}{1-T} \\tag{1} \\label{1} $$ Why is it important ? As we see from (\\ref{1}), the system gets unstable if $KG= -1$. This means that a feedback system will get unstable if $|KG|=1$ with a simultaneous phase lag of 180°.\nWhereas it is good to have control over an output variable up to a certain frequency, we are in many cases also interested in noise suppression. For example, atoms in a dipole trap experience a heating rate proportional to intensity fluctuations at twice the trap frequency. Only by suppressing the laser intensity noise, you can assure long trap lifetimes and/or ground state atoms. For this reason we consider output disturbances $d(s)$ and sensor noise $\\xi (s)$ (see Fig. 2):\n$$ y(s) = \\frac{KG}{1+KG}[ r(s)-\\xi(s)] + \\frac{1}{1+KG}d(s) $$\nWhat does this mean? There are two things to learn from that. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the disturbances, and introduce the sensitivity, sometimes also called noise suppression: $$S = \\frac{1}{1+KG} = 1-T$$ We see that a servo with a high gain leads to a low sensitivity to outside disturbances. The trade-off is that the higher the gain, the noisier the output signal. The reason is that with detector noise the control signal effectively becomes $r(s)-\\xi(s)$, meaning that we cannot distinguish the control signal from measurement noise. Thus the higher the gain, the noisier the output.\n Same system as Fig. 1, but added disturbances d(s) and detector noise.   Another trade-off - which holds for almost all systems (to be exact: if KG has at least two more poles than zeros, and has no poles in the right half plane (is stable)) - is the following: $$\\int_0^\\infty ln|S(s)|ds =0$$ This is known as Bode\u0026rsquo;s sensitivity integral. It means that if you suppress the Sensitivity to disturbances in some frequency regime, you necessarily increase it in some other frequency regime (see Fig. 3 taken from (Citation: Stein,\u0026#32; 2003) Stein,\u0026#32; G. \u0026#32; (2003). \u0026#32;Respect the unstable. IEEE Control Systems Magazine,\u0026#32;23(4).\u0026#32;12–25. https://doi.org/10.1109/mcs.2003.1213600 ).\n If the Sensitivity to disturbances is suppressed in the low frequency regime, it is necessarily increased in some higher frequency regime.   Now before looking at the different systems $G(s)$, we have a look at the control law $K(s)$. The most-used controller is the PID-controller, or very often experimentally only a PI-controller. The P stands for proportional gain, the I for integral gain and the D for derivative gain. Which makes sense if we look at the response in time domain:\n$$u(t) = K_p\\epsilon(t) + K_i\\int \\epsilon(t) dt + K_D \\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt}$$\nIn frequency domain the same thing has the following form:\n$$K(s) = \\frac{u(s)}{\\epsilon(s)} = K_p + \\frac{K_i}{s} + K_Ds$$\nIntensity stabilization Overview For the control of the intensity, we typically have the set-up that is sketched in Fig. 4. The power of the AOM\u0026rsquo;s first order beam is dependent on the RF power: $\\epsilon_{1st order}\\approx\\sin^2(P_{RF}/P_{RF_{sat}})$. Therefore the power of the laser beam that leads to the experiment can be controlled by modulating the RF power.\n A photodiode gets a fraction of the first order AOM beam. The power of this beam can be modulated via RF amplitude modulation.   The System How to characterize the system without PI contol? (\u0026ldquo;system\u0026rdquo; refers to AOM+Driver+AOM+Photodiode) The tools needed for that are a function generator, oscilloscope and a network analyzer. All of that can be found in the RedPitaya controlled by PyRPL we use (see Fig. 5).\n This shows how to characetrize the system without PI-controller. The AOM Driver expects a signal from 0 to 1V to attenuate the RF signal accordingly. This again changes the 1st order beam power and therefore the voltage on the photodiode. The RedPitaya can supply the control voltage for the driver as well as measure the signal on the photodiode.   So what do we measure? As mentioned in the Introduction, we can measure the closed-loop transfer function $T$ and then calculate the open-loop transfer function $H$ to look for a desired loopshape.\nHow to change laser power by modulating RF power The whole intensity stabilization is based on being able to modulate the RF power that goes to the AOM. In our case, we have a home-build AOM driver that allows for this modulation with a control voltage ranging from 0 to 1V. Most drivers work with a Voltage Controlled Oscillator, a Mixer or Variable Voltage Attenuator to attenuate the RF power, and and an amplifier end-stage, because the AOM usually requires 30dBm, while the VCO outputs something much lower.\nTherefore the voltage on the photodiode depends on the control voltage at the AOM driver and the dependency is nonlinear (see figure 6).\n Relationship between control voltage and photodiode voltage. Not that the y-axis is basically arbitrary, as this depends on pick-off ratio and initial laser power.   Analysis in Frequency space with Bode plots The RedPitaya with its network analyzer module, allows us to characterize the setup in frequency space. In the figure above we saw how the Photodiode voltage (laser power) depends on the control voltage on the AOM driver when applying a DC or very low frequency signal. Now we modulate the VCO control voltage with the following: $U_{control}=0.6V+0.01V\\cdot\\sin\\left(2\\cdot\\pi\\cdot f\\cdot t\\right)$ Can the Photodiode follow this modulation up to arbitrary frequency? Probably not, but how can we measure this? The network analyzer can excite the system with above voltage $U_{control}$ and compare the amplitude of oscillation in the and $U_{Photodiode}$ to measure magnitude and phase. It does so by demodulating the photodiode signal with the same sine that was used for excitation and a corresponding cosine, then lowpass-filtering and averaging the two quadratures for a well-defined number of cycles (see Pyrpl API). From the two quadratures it is now possible to extract the magnitude and phase shift of our system in the probed frequency regime. In the figure below we see that for low frequencies the system follows without phase lag and for higher frequencies the phase increasingly lags as the signal magnitude decreases.\n System Transfer Function: Obtained by modulating the RF attenuation of the AOM driver with different frequencies and measuring the corresponding signal on the Photodiode. Do not get confused by the absolute Magnitude of the Gain values: A sinusoidal signal with 1mV amplitude going into the AOM driver does not correspond to a signal with 1mV on the photodiode. This is for example dependent on the offset (because of the slope) or the photodiode amplification. The relative numbers however give you insight in attenuation at higher frequencies and therefore System bandwidth.   It\u0026rsquo;s clear that this system doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any resonances and behaves quiet nicely in the displayed frequency regime. Therefore time-domain tuning methods for a servo like Ziegler-Nichols tuning can be effective and quick. But not every system behaves as nicely as this, so looking at the frequency-regime can be interesting and a way to improve your control, e.g. finding and filtering resonances makes it possible to increase overall gain without sacrificing stability.\nA closed loop After connecting the PI-controller which in our case is also done by the RedPitaya, we close the feedback loop. Now we select some proportional and integral constants such that the intensity is locked to a setpoint we choose. That means that the voltage on the photodetector will be the same as the chosen setpoint. How do we characterize the lock now? How do we know how stable the lock is? How do we know until which frequency noise is surpressed? We take the closed-loop transfer function T using the RedPitaya. With that we can calculate the open-loop transfer function H and look at the sensitivity S.\n Closed-loop transfer function T measured by the RedPitaya. For low frequencies the photodiode voltage follows the modulation well. For higher frequencies the gain of the system decreases. For higher proportional constant the transfer function does not decrease as much at higher frequencies.   After measuring T we can can calculate H. As mentioned in the introduction the criterion for instability is $\\left|H\\right|\u0026gt;1$ for a simultaneously phase lag close to 180°. Be careful that the unit in the figure is dB, which means that $\\left|H\\right|= 1 = 0 dB$. For low frequencies the transfer functino is ruled by the integrator\u0026rsquo;s characteristics. Which means high gain, but only a phase lag of 90°.\n Open-loop transfer function H.   The interesting regime is where the phase lag hits -180° which happens for ~40kHz for the orange curve and ~90kHz for the blue curve. But both sets of P\u0026amp;I-constants lead to stable behaviour, because the magnitude at that point is below 0dB.\nThe conclusion of this analysis shows that we could have gotten away with a higher proportional or integral constant and still have a stable system.\nSensitivity and noise surpression At this stage, we can finally analyse the level of noise suppression in the system.\n Noise spectra locked and unlocked.   We observe noise suppression for frequencies up to point where the system can react actively, which is about 30kHz.\nFurther Reading: Problems of Intensity stabilization Here we can already identify the first pitfall of intensity stabilization. The system, mainly the attenuator inside of the AOM driver, has a proportional gain that depends on the control voltage and is proportional to the slope . The highest gain (slope) is around a control voltage of 0.6V, and the proportional gain for values at 0.4V and 0.9V is very low. On the contrary, the PI-controller has fixed proportional and integral constants.\nIf you only want one specific laser power in your experiment, this does not bother you. You are using more or less one control voltage that gives you the desired laser power and then you tune the proportional constant of your PI-controller such that the system has the biggest bandwidth.\nBut imagine you would want to change this laser power now. By choosing a different setpoint/control voltage you would increase/decrease your proportional gain drastically end end up with an oscillating system or a system with very low bandwidth. If you would want your system to be stable for all control voltages, you would have to make sure that for the highest system proportional gain for a control voltage of 0.6V, you choose your PI-controller proportional gain such that your system is stable. Then you have the biggest bandwidth around a control voltage of 0.6V, but for all other control voltages you would have a smaller bandwidth. Imagine the worst case: You want high laser power for loading your laser dipole trap, and then reduce the trap depth for evaporative cooling by decreasing the laser power by a factor of 100. In the Figure this could for example mean, that you have a photodiode voltage of 9V for loading your trap and 90mV for evaporative cooling. In both cases the slope (proportional gain) is very small. If you want your laser power to be stable and not oscillating during the ramp-down (decrease of factor 100), you would have to accept a low bandwidth in both cases, for the loading and the evaporative cooling. One work-around could be that you sacrifice system-stability during the ramp-down for higher proportional gains in the loading and cooling stage. This however could lead to atom-loss due to parametric heating.\nAnother thing to keep in mind: usually your experimental approach is the following: I want 100mW during the first stage of the experiment and 10mW during the second stage of the experiment. For you to be able to choose a good regime of control voltage values, e.g. 0.5-0.7V, where the AOM Driver gain changes minimally, you have to be able to change either photodiode gain, pick-off ratio or initial laser power.\n","date":1524873600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609843797,"objectID":"f5c20c7a583b48bfbe9e476761c7d312","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/post/2018-feedback-for-amo-experimentalists/","publishdate":"2018-04-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2018-feedback-for-amo-experimentalists/","section":"post","summary":"In this blog-post, we give a short introduction into feedback control for examples that are of interest to AMO experimentalists.","tags":["PID","feedback","laser control","intensity stabilization","tutorial"],"title":"Feedback for AMO experimentalists","type":"post"},{"authors":["Fred Jendrzejewski"],"categories":null,"content":"The Kondo effect is one of the hallmarks of condensed-matter physics. It describes the peculiar interactions between previously non-interacting Fermions, which are induced by a single spin impurity at a certain temperature. Despite (or maybe because of) its large interest as a benchmark for various theoretical frameworks, it is typically quite hard to find accessible introductions in the literature. Here, I will give a very naive interpretation of the Kondo effect and discuss its possible observation in ultracold atomic gases.\nA short history and a naive picture of the Kondo effect The Kondo model was originally proposed in 1964 to describe the appearance of a resistive minimum at a characteristic temperature $T_K$ in certain alloys (Citation: Kondo,\u0026#32; 1964) Kondo,\u0026#32; J. \u0026#32; (1964). \u0026#32;Resistance Minimum in Dilute Magnetic Alloys. Progress of Theoretical Physics,\u0026#32;32(1).\u0026#32;37–49. https://doi.org/10.1143/ptp.32.37 . In this model, a localized magnetic impurity of spin S = 1/2 is interacting with a metal host of non-interacting Fermions with spin s = 1/2. The interaction is described through an anti-ferromagnetic exchange term $H_I = J\\mathbf{s}(0)\\cdot \\mathbf{S}$ with $J \u0026gt; 0$. Because of the anti-ferrmagnetic interaction, we can identify the groundstate of the system as the singlet state, where impurity and electron of opposite spins.\nAt high temperatures, this coupling can be well described by the weak scattering of the Fermions on the impurity and the resistivity is decreasing as the temperature is lowered. Jun Kondo discovered in his seminal paper that the perturbative approach fails in the vicinity of the Kondo temperature $T_K$ as higher order perturbative terms diverge in this regime. Ever since, the Kondo model has inspired a large number of different theoretical approaches to explain the properties of this strongly correlated regime (Citation: Hewson,\u0026#32; 1993) Hewson,\u0026#32; A.\u0026#32; (1993). \u0026#32;The Kondo Problem to Heavy Fermions. \u0026#32; Cambridge University Press. https://doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511470752 , (Citation: Nozieres,\u0026#32; 1975) Nozieres,\u0026#32; P. \u0026#32; (1975). \u0026#32;The Kondo problem : Fancy mathematical techniques versus simple physical ideas.   or (Citation: N.A.)

They interact through an anti-ferromagnetic exchange interaction. a) For low temperatures, the interaction leads to the formation of a spin singlet between a Fermion and the impurity. The high energy cost of creating an excitation in the region of the impurity blocks it entirely from the dynamics of the Fermi sea. The Fermions can now be treated as a Fermi liquid with the impurity region removed. b) For intermediate temperatures the singlet gets deconfined and virtual excitations in the impurity region are allowed. As they involve the neighboring Fermions, they can lead to strong interactions between the previously non-interacting particles. These processes are typically only describable by non-perturbative techniques. c) For high temperatures, the interaction with the impurity is well described by perturbative scattering theory and the system is once again well described by a Fermi liquid.   As sketched in the figure, the following picture has emerged from these works. For low temperatures, $T\\ll T_K$, the impurity spin is confined in a many-body singlet ground state of extension $\\xi_K = \\frac{\\hbar v_F}{k_B T_K}$ , called the Kondo screening cloud. As the spin of the impurity is fully screened, the remaining electrons simply scatter on the region and the usual scattering can take place. For intermediate temperatures, the impurity is still bound in the singlet state, but virtual excitation due to Fermions hopping in the impurity region are allowed (see Fig. 1 b). The virtual excitation by one Fermion polarizes the impurity and this polarization is felt by the neighboring Fermions. Therefore, this process gives rise to interactions between the originally non-interacting Fermions. In the strong coupling regime, $T\\sim T_K$, these interactions are so strong that they cannot be treated perturbatively. For high temperatures, $T\\gg T_K$, the electrons are only weakly scattered by the impurity and the system is again well described by a Fermi liquid (see Fig. 1 c).\nSeveral decades after its first discovery in metals, the Kondo effect has been observed in a multitude of solid-state systems such as quantum dots (Citation: Kastner \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32; 1998) Kastner,\u0026#32; M.,\u0026#32; Goldhaber-Gordon,\u0026#32; D.,\u0026#32; Shtrikman,\u0026#32; H.,\u0026#32; Mahalu,\u0026#32; D.,\u0026#32; Abusch-Magder,\u0026#32; D.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Meirav,\u0026#32; U. \u0026#32; (1998). \u0026#32;Kondo effect in a single-electron transistor.

Dynamical and spatial properties, which would be observable on time scales of $t \\ll \\frac{\\hbar}{k_B T_K} \\sim$ps, remain inaccessible in these solid-state systems. Such measurement would be however highly desirable, as the Kondo model (and its generalization in form of the Anderson model) is nowadays one of the standard benchmarks for calculations on dynamical and real space properties, where our theoretical understanding is much less complete than in the equilibrium case (Citation: Polkovnikov \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32; 2011) Polkovnikov,\u0026#32; A.,\u0026#32; Sengupta,\u0026#32; K.,\u0026#32; Silva,\u0026#32; A.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Vengalattore,\u0026#32; M. \u0026#32; (2011). \u0026#32;Colloquium: Nonequilibrium dynamics of closed interacting quantum systems.

They have already proven to be a fantastic tool for the study of several simple impurity problems resulting in numerous intriguing quantum effects. In the simplest case, the impurities are static. They form a static disorder, which first leads to the well-known diffusion, but can eventually result in Anderson localization via the quantum interference between different diffusive paths (Citation: Anderson,\u0026#32; 1958) Anderson,\u0026#32; P. \u0026#32; (1958). \u0026#32;Absence of Diffusion in Certain Random Lattices.

The local gauge symmetry is realized in an optical superlattice, using heteronuclear boson-fermion spin-changing interactions which preserve the total spin in every local collision. We consider a large number of bosons residing in the coherent state of a Bose-Einstein condensate on each link between the fermion lattice sites, such that the behavior of lattice QED in the continuum limit can be recovered. The discussion about the range of possible experimental parameters builds, in particular, upon experiences with related setups of fermions interacting with coherent samples of bosonic atoms. We determine the atomic system's parameters required for the description of fundamental QED processes, such as Schwinger pair production and string breaking. This is achieved by benchmark calculations of the atomic system and of QED itself using functional integral techniques. Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of one-dimensional QED may be realized with ultracold atoms using state-of-the-art experimental resources. The experimental setup proposed may provide a unique access to longstanding open questions for which classical computational methods are no longer applicable.","tags":["\"lattice gauge theory\"","\"original content from this\"","\"quantum simulation\"","\"schwinger pair production\""],"title":"Implementing quantum electrodynamics with ultracold atomic systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Avinash Kumar","Stephen Eckel","Fred Jendrzejewski","Gretchen K.

Starting far from equilibrium (superfluid in a single reservoir), we observe first resistive flow transitioning at a critical current into superflow, characterized by long-lived oscillations. We reproduce this full evolution with a simple electronic circuit model. We find that the resistance is consistent with phase slips and the associated creation of vortices, as proposed in [R. P.

Our system allows only a few single-particle, transverse modes to propagate, a situation that, for fermions, would lead to a conductance of only a few $h^-1$.

We characterize the interferometer when it contains a single particle, which is initially in a coherent superposition of a torus and reference state, as well as when it contains a many-body state in the mean-field approximation. The single-particle picture is sufficient to explain the origin of the spirals, to relate the phase-drop across the barrier to the geometry of a spiral, and to bound the expansion times for which the in situ phase can be accurately determined. Mean-field estimates and numerical simulations show that the interatomic interactions shorten the expansion time scales compared to the single-particle case.

Hysteresis is widely used in electronic circuits-it is routinely observed in superconducting circuits and is essential in radio-frequency superconducting quantum interference devices. Furthermore, it is as fundamental to superfluidity (and superconductivity) as quantized persistent currents, critical velocity and Josephson effects. Nevertheless, despite multiple theoretical predictions, hysteresis has not been previously observed in any superfluid, atomic-gas Bose-Einstein condensate. Here we directly detect hysteresis between quantized circulation states in an atomtronic circuit formed from a ring of superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate obstructed by a rotating weak link (a region of low atomic density). This contrasts with previous experiments on superfluid liquid helium where hysteresis was observed directly in systems in which the quantization of flow could not be observed, and indirectly in systems that showed quantized flow. Our techniques allow us to tune the size of the hysteresis loop and to consider the fundamental excitations that accompany hysteresis. The results suggest that the relevant excitations involved in hysteresis are vortices, and indicate that dissipation has an important role in the dynamics. Controlled hysteresis in atomtronic circuits may prove to be a crucial feature for the development of practical devices, just as it has in electronic circuits such as memories, digital noise filters (for example Schmitt triggers) and magnetometers (for example superconducting quantum interference devices).","tags":["jqi","hysteresis","superfluid","ultracold"],"title":"Hysteresis in a quantized superfluid 'atomtronic' circuit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fred Jendrzejewski","Kilian Müller","Jeremie Richard","Aditya Date","Thomas Plisson","Philippe Bouyer","Alain Aspect","Vincent Josse"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609328303,"objectID":"7c93faeedcaa43c98e8aa2d0be671818","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/publication/jendrzejewski-2012/","publishdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jendrzejewski-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"We report on the direct observation of coherent backscattering (CBS) of ultracold atoms in a quasi-two- dimensional configuration.
