Lattice gauge theories are a particular important class of quantum systems with an extensive number of local constraints and play a central role in high energy physics, condensed matter and quantum information. Whereas recent experimental progress points towards the feasibility of large-scale quantum simulation of Abelian gauge theories, the quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories appears still elusive. In this paper we present minimal non-Abelian lattice gauge theories, whereby we introduce the necessary formalism in well-known Abelian gauge theories, such as the Jaynes-Cumming model. In particular, we show that certain minimal non-Abelian lattice gauge theories can be mapped to three or four level systems, for which the design of a quantum simulator is standard with current technologies. Further we give an upper bound for the Hilbert space dimension of a one dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory, and argue that the implementation with current digital quantum computer appears feasible.","tags":["Quantum Simulation","Lattice Gauge Theory"],"title":"From the Jaynes–Cummings model to non-abelian gauge theories: a guided tour for the quantum engineer.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fred Jendrzejewski","Apoorva Hegde","Rohit Prasad Bhatt"],"categories":null,"content":"This is a block seminar, which will be organized together with experts from IBM-Q, we will explore the possibilities of quantum hardware like cold atom machines and IBM-Q to solve a variety of problems.

Hereby, we put the largest possible focus on a hands-on experience, where we try to support the students to solve specific problems.\nThe seminar is planned to be loosely based on the ideas of hackathons. As such, we have roughly planned the following schedule:\nEach day has a morning session starting at 9am and an afternoon session. On Monday you will obtain an introduction into the two main platforms we would like to employ in this lecture. On Tuesday morning we discuss the proposed tools for coding, which will be most likely jupyter environments, github and python. Starting on Tuesday afternoon you have until Friday morning to work through a project in team of a few people. On Friday afternoon you will present the results in a short presentation and discuss them with the other students. During the week you will be supported by members of IBMQ and teaching stuff from our University.\nFurther technical points:\n The seminar lectures and presentations will happen online. We will provide you a room if the members of the team are in HD, but this is optional. The lectures will be given through zoom, the links will be provided later. Communication during the week will happen through a slack channel on qiskit.slack.com Quantum code can be run on the ibm quantum experience. Instructions for registration will follow.

Experimentally, the building block is realized by Bose-Einstein condensates of lithium and sodium condense d in a single optical dipole trap. Gauge and matter degrees of freedom are mapped in this system onto the internal states of the atomic species. The necessary U(1) gauge invariance is realized via heteronuclear spin changing collisions (SCC) between both species.\nThe building block represents an important stepstone towards quantum simulation of extended lattice gauge theories as, within the same setting, it features systematic protection of gauge invariance, a realistic approach of the continuum limit for gauge fields and the potential for scalability.\nUsing SCC, systematic protection of gauge invariance in the system is achieved by exploiting the inherent angular momentum conservation in the atomic mixture. The continuum limit of gauge fields is recovered in the framework of quantum link models by working with Bose-Einstein condensates with high atom numbers in the order of $10^5$. The building block can be scaled up to an extended U(1) lattice gauge theory by arranging individual building blocks on the sites of an optical lattice and connecting them via Raman-assisted tunneling.\nGreat tunability of our experimental building block is demonstrated by studying SCC dynamics as a function of various experimental parameters. We observe coherent SCC interactions between both species after an initialization quench. Furthermore, we recorded the SCC resonance as a function of this initialization quench and the offset magnetic field. We present a theoretical framework for the building block model based on a mean field theory with a phenomenological decoherence term. Within this framework the experimental SCC measurements are excellently described, identifying our experimental system as a faithful representation of the building block.\nOur results open up the possibility for extended lattice gauge theories based on multiple building blocks. These systems will allow for quantum simulation of gauge theories with the potential to address important questions in modern physics that can currently not be simulated by classical computational techniques.","tags":["Ultracold","Atomic mixture","Lithium","Sodium","lattice gauge theory","dynamical gauge fields"],"title":"Experimental realization of U(1) gauge invariance in ultracold atomic mixtures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Hesse","Kerim Köster","Jakob Steiner","Julia Michl","Vadim Vorobyov","Durga Dasari","Jörg Wrachtrup","Fred Jendrzejewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1584489600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609656932,"objectID":"8c5f7fc3f01a1aaa03efe97e18d768b5","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/publication/hesse-2020/","publishdate":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hesse-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"In atomic physics experiments, magnetic fields allow to control the interactions between atoms, eg. near Feshbach resonances, or by employing spin changing collisions.

Using this trap, an implementation of a quantized Otto cycle with the sodium-lithium mixture experiment that cools down a cloud of sodium atoms to quantum degeneracy while conserving the number of atoms may be possible. Three key characteristics which are crucial to the quantum Otto cycle are described: First, spatial movement of the lithium cloud is implemented by adjusting the relative phase of the two interfering beams up to $\\Delta \\theta = 3\\pi$. Second, the energy level spacing in the trap are adjustable by controlling the laser intensity. Third, the spatial overlap between clouds of sodium and lithium atoms can be optimized by an accordion setup with two electric tunable lenses which allows to change the periodicity of the standing-wave dynamically by a factor of two. Furthermore, the stability of the setup is characterized. An estimate on the trap storage time based on heating rates by spontaneous emission, intensity and trap center fluctuations is given. In the current setup, the storage time is limited by detuning and power of the laser. With a 5nm blue-detuned setup the estimated storage time is up to 4s, whereas intensity and trap center fluctuations would allow for a estimated lifetime of bigger than 80s. The longterm trap center stability was characterized and substantially improved by temperature stabilization of the electro-optical modulator crystal to approximately $0.3/\\pi = 12 h$. In the near future, this setup will be installed on the main experiment, allowing the sodium-lithium experiment to become a test-bed for quantum thermodynamics.","tags":["Ultracold","Atomic mixture","Lithium","Sodium","quantumthermo","Quantum thermodynamics","Accordion lattice"],"title":"Implementing an Optical Accordion Lattice for the Realization of a Quantized Otto Cycle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P Bienias","S Subhankar","Y Wang","T-c Tsui","Fred Jendrzejewski","T Tiecke","L Jiang","S L Rolston","J V Porto","A V Gorshkov"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1530921600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609310819,"objectID":"46d6c331523d8343e22780a13599718f","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/publication/bienias-2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bienias-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"There has been a recent surge of interest and progress in creating subwavelength free-space optical potentials for ultracold atoms.

Future progress towards scalable quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories, however, hinges crucially on the efficient use of experimental resources. As we argue in this work, due to the fundamental non-uniqueness of discretizing the relativistic Dirac Hamiltonian, the lattice representation of gauge theories allows for an optimization that up to now has been left unexplored. We exemplify our discussion with lattice quantum electrodynamics in two-dimensional space-time, where we show that the formulation through Wilson fermions provides several advantages over the previously considered staggered fermions. Notably, it enables a strongly simplified optical lattice setup and it reduces the number of degrees of freedom required to simulate dynamical gauge fields.

We consider a large number of bosons residing in the coherent state of a Bose-Einstein condensate on each link between the fermion lattice sites, such that the behavior of lattice QED in the continuum limit can be recovered. The discussion about the range of possible experimental parameters builds, in particular, upon experiences with related setups of fermions interacting with coherent samples of bosonic atoms. We determine the atomic system's parameters required for the description of fundamental QED processes, such as Schwinger pair production and string breaking. This is achieved by benchmark calculations of the atomic system and of QED itself using functional integral techniques.

Hysteresis is widely used in electronic circuits-it is routinely observed in superconducting circuits and is essential in radio-frequency superconducting quantum interference devices. Furthermore, it is as fundamental to superfluidity (and superconductivity) as quantized persistent currents, critical velocity and Josephson effects. Nevertheless, despite multiple theoretical predictions, hysteresis has not been previously observed in any superfluid, atomic-gas Bose-Einstein condensate. Here we directly detect hysteresis between quantized circulation states in an atomtronic circuit formed from a ring of superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate obstructed by a rotating weak link (a region of low atomic density). This contrasts with previous experiments on superfluid liquid helium where hysteresis was observed directly in systems in which the quantization of flow could not be observed, and indirectly in systems that showed quantized flow. Our techniques allow us to tune the size of the hysteresis loop and to consider the fundamental excitations that accompany hysteresis. The results suggest that the relevant excitations involved in hysteresis are vortices, and indicate that dissipation has an important role in the dynamics. Controlled hysteresis in atomtronic circuits may prove to be a crucial feature for the development of practical devices, just as it has in electronic circuits such as memories, digital noise filters (for example Schmitt triggers) and magnetometers (for example superconducting quantum interference devices).","tags":["jqi","hysteresis","superfluid","ultracold"],"title":"Hysteresis in a quantized superfluid 'atomtronic' circuit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fred Jendrzejewski","Kilian Müller","Jeremie Richard","Aditya Date","Thomas Plisson","Philippe Bouyer","Alain Aspect","Vincent Josse"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609328303,"objectID":"7c93faeedcaa43c98e8aa2d0be671818","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/publication/jendrzejewski-2012/","publishdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jendrzejewski-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"We report on the direct observation of coherent backscattering (CBS) of ultracold atoms in a quasi-two- dimensional configuration.
