Several seconds later one can still reconstruct the position of the impact from the waves it caused. How well two events (rock impact and waves) at different positions and times are correlated, tells us something about how regular or chaotic the dynamics of a system is. If it was windy and the pond surface wasn\u0026rsquo;t calm but turbulent, the regular waves would disappear much more quickly. The general physical concept behind this simple observation is the one of dynamical response functions. Measuring these objects requires to measure correlations between different positions and times. In the lab, we can prepare and control quantum systems nearly perfectly and thus study these correlation functions in engineered model systems. The ability to resolve the dynamical response function in such highly tunable systems allows us to study the transition from regular to chaotic behavior. An additional twist is added by the fact that we can also time-reverse the dynamics, i.e. let the waves propagate backwards again.

In this proposed setup, one atomic species realizes localized collective spins of tunable length, which form the fundamental unit of information. The second atomic species yields phononic excitations, which are used to entangle collective spins.

Lattice gauge theories are a particular important class of quantum systems with an extensive number of local constraints and play a central role in high energy physics, condensed matter and quantum information. Whereas recent experimental progress points towards the feasibility of large-scale quantum simulation of Abelian gauge theories, the quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories appears still elusive. In this paper we present minimal non-Abelian lattice gauge theories, whereby we introduce the necessary formalism in well-known Abelian gauge theories, such as the Jaynes-Cumming model. In particular, we show that certain minimal non-Abelian lattice gauge theories can be mapped to three or four level systems, for which the design of a quantum simulator is standard with current technologies. Further we give an upper bound for the Hilbert space dimension of a one dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory, and argue that the implementation with current digital quantum computer appears feasible.","tags":["Quantum Simulation","Lattice Gauge Theory"],"title":"From the Jaynes–Cummings model to non-abelian gauge theories: a guided tour for the quantum engineer.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fred Jendrzejewski"],"categories":null,"content":"In the upcoming summer semester, I am seminar on quantum experiments together with Lauriane Chomaz.\n","date":1601251200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609225162,"objectID":"0511ffc6953c292267e28d97f7eb96e4","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/teaching/2021-quantum-simulation-seminar/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/2021-quantum-simulation-seminar/","section":"teaching","summary":"In this lecture, Fred Jendrzejewski will discuss fundamentals experiments of quantum mechanics.","tags":null,"title":"Building synthetic quantum systems with photons, ions and neutral atoms","type":"teaching"},{"authors":["Fred Jendrzejewski"],"categories":null,"content":"More details to come.\n","date":1601251200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609225162,"objectID":"a51d87723d47ab8ea52ed75d77fe7989","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/teaching/2020-solving-problems/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/2020-solving-problems/","section":"teaching","summary":"A one week workshop on quantum hardware together with IBMQ","tags":null,"title":"Solving problems on quantum hardware","type":"teaching"},{"authors":["hauke"],"categories":null,"content":"More details to come.\n","date":1586217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609225162,"objectID":"8ccaad9baff05ddd869102edb2cac58e","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/teaching/2018-aamo/","publishdate":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/2018-aamo/","section":"teaching","summary":"All you ever wanted to know about AMO","tags":null,"title":"Advanced AMO","type":"teaching"},{"authors":["hauke"],"categories":null,"content":"More details to come.\n","date":1586217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609225162,"objectID":"8b94230d556473d1f7ecbe81ff24e05a","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/teaching/2019-aamo/","publishdate":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/2019-aamo/","section":"teaching","summary":"All you ever wanted to know about AMO","tags":null,"title":"Advanced AMO","type":"teaching"},{"authors":["Alexander Hesse","Kerim Köster","Jakob Steiner","Julia Michl","Vadim Vorobyov","Durga Dasari","Jörg Wrachtrup","Fred Jendrzejewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1584489600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609310819,"objectID":"8c5f7fc3f01a1aaa03efe97e18d768b5","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/publication/hesse-2020/","publishdate":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hesse-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"In atomic physics experiments, magnetic fields allow to control the interactions between atoms, eg. near Feshbach resonances, or by employing spin changing collisions. The magnetic field control is typically performed indirectly, by stabilizing the current of Helmholtz coils producing the large bias field. Here, we overcome the limitations of such an indirect control through a direct feedback scheme, which is based on nitrogen-vacancy centers acting as a sensor. This allows us to measure and stabilize magnetic fields of 46.6 G down to 1.2 mG RMS noise, with the potential of reaching much higher field strengths. Because the magnetic field is measured directly, we reach minimum shot-to-shot fluctuations of 0.32(4) ppm on a 22 minute time interval, ensuring high reproducibility of experiments. This approach extends the direct magnetic field control to high magnetic fields, which could enable new precise quantum simulations in this regime.","tags":["NV","magnetometry","under-grad","atomic-mixtures","experiment","ultracold","kip"],"title":"Direct control of high magnetic fields for cold atom experiments based on NV centers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Mil","Torsten V.

Furthermore, it is as fundamental to superfluidity (and superconductivity) as quantized persistent currents, critical velocity and Josephson effects. Nevertheless, despite multiple theoretical predictions, hysteresis has not been previously observed in any superfluid, atomic-gas Bose-Einstein condensate. Here we directly detect hysteresis between quantized circulation states in an atomtronic circuit formed from a ring of superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate obstructed by a rotating weak link (a region of low atomic density). This contrasts with previous experiments on superfluid liquid helium where hysteresis was observed directly in systems in which the quantization of flow could not be observed, and indirectly in systems that showed quantized flow. Our techniques allow us to tune the size of the hysteresis loop and to consider the fundamental excitations that accompany hysteresis. The results suggest that the relevant excitations involved in hysteresis are vortices, and indicate that dissipation has an important role in the dynamics. Controlled hysteresis in atomtronic circuits may prove to be a crucial feature for the development of practical devices, just as it has in electronic circuits such as memories, digital noise filters (for example Schmitt triggers) and magnetometers (for example superconducting quantum interference devices).","tags":["jqi","hysteresis","superfluid","ultracold"],"title":"Hysteresis in a quantized superfluid 'atomtronic' circuit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fred Jendrzejewski","Kilian Müller","Jeremie Richard","Aditya Date","Thomas Plisson","Philippe Bouyer","Alain Aspect","Vincent Josse"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609328303,"objectID":"7c93faeedcaa43c98e8aa2d0be671818","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/publication/jendrzejewski-2012/","publishdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jendrzejewski-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"We report on the direct observation of coherent backscattering (CBS) of ultracold atoms in a quasi-two- dimensional configuration.

Instead, our data are compatible with the self-consistent theory of Anderson localization tailored to our system, involving a heuristic energy shift that offers scope for future interpretation.","tags":["iogs","disordered","ultracold","Anderson localization"],"title":"Three-dimensional localization of ultracold atoms in an optical disordered potential","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fred Jendrzejewski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609225162,"objectID":"1cccedaf72802f158856f0415b51e005","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/publication/jendrzejewski-2012-b/","publishdate":"2020-12-28T14:25:19.160989Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jendrzejewski-2012-b/","section":"publication","summary":"In this thesis we study the quantum transport of matter waves with ultracold atoms. Such ultracold atom systems provide a very good control and a high flexibility of the parameters of the systems like the interactions, its dimensionality and the external potentials. This makes them a great tool for the investigation of several fundamental concepts of condensed matter physics. We focus on the quantumtransport in disordered media. It differs to classical transport by the fundamental role played by inference phenomena, which can eventually lead to the suppression of transport; known as Anderson Localization. Observing the expansion of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a strong light disorder, we show evidence for Localization of ultracold atoms in three dimensions. In the last part of this manuscript we discuss the observation of Coherent Backscat- tering of ultracold atoms, which is a direct signal of the role of quantum coherence in quantum transport in disordered media. We observe the time evolution of the momentum distribution of a cloud of ultra-cold atoms, launched with a narrow velocity distribution in a disordered potential. A peak emerges in in the backwards direction, corresponding to the CBS signal.","tags":["\"Anderson Localization\"","\"Bose-Einstein condensate\"","\"Coherent Backscattering\"","\"Coherent backscattering\"","\"Cold Atoms\"","\"Disorder\"","\"Matter wave\"","\"Quantum transport\"","\"Ultracold Atoms\""],"title":"Quantum transport of ultracold atoms in disordered potentials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alain Bernard","William Guerin","Juliette Billy","Fred Jendrzejewski","Patrick Cheinet","Alain Aspect","Vincent Josse","Philippe Bouyer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1309219200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609328303,"objectID":"2eab921e94e7c254863d0891c08301b2","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/publication/bernard-2011/","publishdate":"2011-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bernard-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"We study in detail the flux properties of a radiofrequency (rf) outcoupled horizontally guided atom laser by following the scheme demonstrated by Guerin W et al (2006 Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 200402). Both the outcoupling spectrum (flux of the atom laser versus rf frequency of the outcoupler) and the flux limitations imposed on operating in the quasi- continuous regime are investigated. These aspects are studied using a quasi-one- dimensional model, whose predictions are shown to be in fair agreement with the experimental observations. This work allows us to identify the operating range of the guided atom laser and to confirm its promises with regard to studying quantum transport phenomena.","tags":["iogs","atom-laser","ultracold"],"title":"Quasi-continuous horizontally guided atom laser: coupling spectrum and flux limits","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609225162,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609225162,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609225162,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
