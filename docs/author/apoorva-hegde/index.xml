      <title>Dynamical Gauge Fields</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Within the Standard Model of Particle Physics, the interaction between fundamental particles is described by gauge theories. These theories have an enormous predictive power, but to compute the dynamics they generate is an extremely hard task. As a consequence, high-energy physics contains many unsolved problems such as quark confinement or the dynamics of quarks and gluons during heavy-ion collisions. Instead of computing them in classical devices or investigating them in enormous accelerator facilities, we aim at implementing lattice gauge theories on the optical table by having atomic gases in optical lattices mimic the interplay between particles, anti-particles, and gauge bosons. In this way, experiments at temperatures just above absolute zero could give insights into unsolved phenomena that in Nature appear at very high energies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Solving problems on quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/teaching/2020-solving-problems/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://jendrzejewski.synqs.org/teaching/2020-solving-problems/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a block seminar, which will be organized together with experts from IBM-Q, we will explore the possibilities of quantum hardware like cold atom machines and IBM-Q to solve a variety of problems. It will run during the week of October 5th to October 9th for the full day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will put special focus on a practical implementation of simple algorithms through the publicly available IBM-Q machine in the exercises and benchmark them with hardware, which is developed in Heidelberg. Hereby, we put the largest possible focus on a hands-on experience, where we try to support the students to solve specific problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seminar is planned to be loosely based on the ideas of hackathons. As such, we have roughly planned the following schedule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day has a morning session starting at 9am and an afternoon session.
On Monday you will obtain an introduction into the two main platforms we would like to employ in this lecture.
On Tuesday morning we discuss the proposed tools for coding, which will be most likely jupyter environments, github and python.
Starting on Tuesday afternoon you have until Friday morning to work through a project in team of a few people.
On Friday afternoon you will present the results in a short presentation and discuss them with the other students.
During the week you will be supported by members of IBMQ and teaching stuff from our University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further technical points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seminar lectures and presentations will happen online. We will provide you a room if the members of the team are in HD, but this is optional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lectures will be given through zoom, the links will be provided later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication during the week will happen through a slack channel on qiskit.slack.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantum code can be run on the ibm quantum experience. Instructions for registration will follow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication will be most likely happening through slack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Random walks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantum chemistry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lattice gauge theories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
