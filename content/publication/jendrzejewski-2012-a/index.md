abstract: In disordered media, quantum interference effects are expected to induce
  complete suppression of electron conduction. The phenomenon, known as Anderson localization,
  has a counterpart with classical waves that has been observed in acoustics, electromagnetism
  and optics, but a direct observation for particles remains elusive. Here, we report
  the observation of the three-dimensional localization of ultracold atoms in a disordered
  potential created by a speckle laser field.Aphenomenological analysis of our data
  distinguishes a localized component of the resulting density profile from a diffusive
  component. The observed localization cannot be interpreted as the classical trapping
  of particles with energy below the classical percolation threshold in the disorder,
  nor can it be understood as quantum trapping in local potential minima. Instead,
  our data are compatible with the self-consistent theory of Anderson localization
  tailored to our system, involving a heuristic energy shift that offers scope for
  future interpretation.
