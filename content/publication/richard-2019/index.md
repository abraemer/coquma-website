abstract: We report on the direct measurement of the elastic scattering time $backslashtau_backslashmathrms$
  of ultracold atoms propagating in optical disordered potentials. By exploring this
  fundamental quantity over a large range of experimental parameters, we observe variations
  of $backslashtau_backslashmathrms$ over more than three orders of magnitude, in
  excellent agreement with numerical calculations. It allows us to study the crossover
  from the weak to the strong scattering regimes, which are explicitly identified
  by a comparison to the first order Born approximation. We especially discuss the
  relevance of the widely used criterion $k l_backslashmathrmsbackslashsim 1$ to locate
  this crossover. While it is validated for a Gaussian disorder, it breaks down for
  the laser speckle disorders used in the experiments, where large deviations to Born
  predictions are observed. This result highlights the strong influence of the disorder
  statistics on the crossover and, more generally, on the behavior of the time $backslashtau_backslashmathrms$
  in the strong scattering regime.
