abstract: We propose to implement a quantized thermal machine based on a mixture of
  two atomic species. One atomic species implements the working medium and the other
  implements two (cold and hot) baths. We show that such a setup can be employed for
  the refrigeration of a large bosonic cloud starting above and ending below the condensation
  threshold. We analyze its operation in a regime conforming to the quantized Otto
  cycle and discuss the prospects for continuous-cycle operation, addressing the experimental
  as well as theoretical limitations. Beyond its applicative significance, this setup
  has a potential for the study of fundamental questions of quantum thermodynamics.
