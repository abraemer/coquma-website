Our research is (and has been) supported through a generous funding from external partners:

- We are part of _Emmy-Noether research program_ of the **DFG** since 2017. It is focused on the [Kondo effect in cold atoms](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/377616843?context=projekt&task=showDetail&id=377616843&s).
- We are part of the _CRC IsoQuant_, funded by the **DFG**, since 2016.  In close collaboration with the group of JÃ¼rgen Berges we work on the [implementation of lattice gauge theories with effect in cold atoms](https://www.isoquant-heidelberg.de/project/cold-atom-gauge-theories/).
- We are part of the _FOR 2724_, funded by the **DFG**, the since 2018. It focuses on [thermal machines in the quantum world](https://www.quantumthermo.de/).
- We are part of the project [EnerQuant](https://enerquant.de), funded by the **BMWI**, since 2020. In close collaboration with the group of {{% mention "hauke" %}}, Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Mathematics ([ITWM](https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/)), and [JoS QUANTUM GmbH](https://jos-quantum.de/), we investigate possible quantum simulators for the energy market.
- We are supported by the [Honda Research Institute](https://www.honda-ri.de/) (**HRI**) since 2021 to investigate quantum machine learning with cold atoms.
